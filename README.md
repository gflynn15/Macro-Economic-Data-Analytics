# Macro-Economic-Data-Analytics
Respository Description:This repository contains projects I have worked on utilizing excel
Project Purpose: 
This analysis was conducted because of a noticed historical rise on the CPI. I then wanted to understand how this rise in the CPI is ultimately impacting the labor force. What can be extracted from this analysis is that the CPI has a strong positive correlation value with the number of US employees working more than 1 job. This can play a major impact on US morale as employees are having to work more hours to keep up with rising grocery prices. 

Project Scope: Measure the level of impact CPI has on the number of individuals working more than 1 job. 

Data Sources Utilized:
1. Historical Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U): U.S. city average, all items, by month
2. (Unadj) Multiple Jobholders, Primary Job Full Time, Secondary Job Part Time
- Both data sources were downloaded from the Bureau of Labor Statistics website to ensure data utilized for the analysis was authetic and produced from a reputable site.

Key Statistic Definitions: 
1. CPI:  measure that examines the average change over time in the prices paid by consumers for a basket of goods and services. It is a widely used indicator of inflation and cost of living.
2. Multi Job Holders: US employees working more than one job.
3. Correlation Coefficient: statistical measure that describes the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables.
4. Slope: representing the rate of change between two variables in a linear relationship.
5. Linear Regression: statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (predictors) using a straight line.

This is a snapshot of the Summary Analytics Sheet:

What can be seen from the summary analytics sheet is that the CPI has a very strong positive correlation value with the number of US residents having to work more than 1 job. Over the years, consumer goods prices has been on a steady incline since 2015 and is showing no trends of decline. The CPI is showcasing this information for us. When consumer goods pricing increases this increases the level of financial strain residents of the US face when making purchases. That is resulting in more Americans having to work more than 1 job so that they can keep up with the rising prices in the US. 
Looking ahead, the forecasted trend charts show that consumer pricing is projected to continue increasing through 2028 which means more Americans will be looking to work more than 1 job to make ends meat. This can cause a decrease in morale for the Americans which could potentially lead to larger macro market impacts later on for elastic goods sales.
